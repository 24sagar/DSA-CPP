Day 2: Graph

Study Theory (2 hours)
•	Graph Representation: Adjacency matrix, adjacency list.
•	Graph Traversal: Depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS).

Practice (2 hours)
•	Implement graph representation using adjacency matrix and adjacency list.
•	Implement DFS and BFS traversal algorithms.
