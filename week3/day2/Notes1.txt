Representation of Graphs
There are two ways to store a graph:

Adjacency Matrix
Adjacency List


Adjacency Matrix
In this method, the graph is stored in the form of the 2D matrix where rows and columns denote vertices. 
Each entry in the matrix represents the weight of the edge between those vertices. 

Adjacency List
This graph is represented as a collection of linked lists. There is an array of pointer which points to the edges connected to that vertex. 


Basic Operations on Graphs
Below are the basic operations on the graph:

Insertion of Nodes/Edges in the graph – Insert a node into the graph.
Deletion of Nodes/Edges in the graph – Delete a node from the graph.
Searching on Graphs – Search an entity in the graph.
Traversal of Graphs – Traversing all the nodes in the graph.
