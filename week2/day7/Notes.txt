What is a queue?

A queue is a data structure in which whatever comes first will go out first, and it follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) policy. 
Insertion in the queue is done from one end known as the rear end or the tail, whereas the deletion is done from another end known as the front 
end or the head of the queue.

The real-world example of a queue is the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, 
where the person who enters first in the queue gets the ticket first, and the person enters last in the queue gets the ticket at last.


What is a Deque (or double-ended queue)

The deque stands for Double Ended Queue. Deque is a linear data structure where the insertion and deletion operations are performed from both ends.
We can say that deque is a generalized version of the queue.

There are two types of deque -

Input restricted queue
In input restricted queue, insertion operation can be performed at only one end, while deletion can be performed from both ends.

Output restricted queue
In output restricted queue, deletion operation can be performed at only one end, while insertion can be performed from both ends.


Operations performed on deque
There are the following operations that can be applied on a deque -

Insertion at front
Insertion at rear
Deletion at front
Deletion at rear


Breadth First Search

Breadth First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm. It involves visiting all the connected nodes of a graph in a level-by-level manner.
BFS is commonly used in algorithms for pathfinding, connected components, and shortest path problems in graphs.
