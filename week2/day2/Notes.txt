C++ Multidimensional Array

An array is a type of data structure used to store the collection of the same data type items held at contiguous memory locations.

A multidimensional array is an array with more than one dimension.
It is the homogeneous collection of items where each element is accessed using multiple indices.


datatype arrayName[size1][size2];

A two-dimensional array in C++ is a collection of elements organized in rows and columns.

Initialization of 2D array using Loops

int x[2][4];
for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++){
    for(int j = 0; j < 4; j++){
        x[i][j] = 1;
    }
}

What is a Jagged Array?
A jagged array is an array of arrays such that member arrays can be of different sizes, in 2D array terms for each row we can have a variable number of columns.
These types of arrays are also known as Jagged arrays.
