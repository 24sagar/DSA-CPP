Structures, Unions and Enumerations in C++

The structure is a user-defined data type that is available in C++.
Structures are used to combine different types of data types, just like an array is used to combine the same type of data types.
A structure is declared by using the keyword “struct“. 
When we declare a variable of the structure we need to write the keyword “struct in C language but for C++ the keyword is not mandatory

Syntax:

struct 
{
   // Declaration of the struct
}

Structure using typedef: typedef is a keyword that is used to assign a new name to any existing data-type.

typedef struct GeekForGeeks {
 
    int G1;
    char G2;
    float G3;
 
} GFG;


Unions: 
A union is a type of structure that can be used where the amount of memory used is a key factor. 
Similarly to the structure, the union can contain different types of data types.

// Defining a Union
union GFG {
    int Geek1;
    char Geek2;
    float Geek3;
};

// Initializing Union
    union GFG G1;
    

Enums: Enums are user-defined types that consist of named integral constants.

It helps to assign constants to a set of names to make the program easier to read, maintain and understand.
An Enumeration is declared by using the keyword “enum“.

/ Defining  an enum
enum GeeksforGeeks { Geek1, Geek2, Geek3 };
 
GeeksforGeeks G1 = Geek1;
GeeksforGeeks G2 = Geek2;
GeeksforGeeks G3 = Geek3;

In the above code, the named constants like Geek1, Geek2, and Geek3 have assigned integral values such as 0, 1, 2 respectively while the output is given.

new and delete Operators in C++ For Dynamic Memory
Dynamic memory allocation in C/C++ refers to performing memory allocation manually by a programmer.
Dynamically allocated memory is allocated on Heap, and non-static and local variables get memory allocated on Stack 

new operator
The new operator denotes a request for memory allocation on the Free Store.
// Combine declaration of pointer 
// and their assignment
int *p = new int; 

delete operator
Since it is the programmer’s responsibility to deallocate dynamically allocated memory, programmers are provided delete operator in C++ language. 
Syntax: 

// Release memory pointed by pointer-variable
delete pointer-variable;
