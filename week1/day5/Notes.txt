Linear Search:
Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each 
element of a list until the desired element or group of elements is found.


Binary Search:
Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array. 
In this algorithm, the element is found by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and deciding the next interval to find the element.

Bubble Sort Algorithm
In Bubble Sort algorithm, 

traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. 
In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.



Selection Sort

Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly 
selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.
